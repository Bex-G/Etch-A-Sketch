This digital "Etch-A-Sketch" marks my first honest attempt at using DOM manipulation. As such, it gave me a great opportunity to practice basic DOM methods, a few different types of event listeners, and a fresh slew of increasingly complicated functions.

The trickiest part was designing a variable set of divs that could grow or shrink to fill a container (or sketchpad) of a fixed size.

Just for fun, I also added the abilty to draw in randomly generated color values. Happy sketching!
